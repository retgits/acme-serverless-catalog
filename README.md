# Catalog

> A catalog service, because what is a shop without a catalog to show off our awesome red pants?

The Catalog service is part of the [ACME Fitness Serverless Shop](https://github.com/retgits/acme-serverless). The goal of this specific service is to register and serve the catalog of items sold by the shop.

## Prerequisites

* [Go (at least Go 1.12)](https://golang.org/dl/)
* [An AWS Account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup)
* The _vuln_ targets for Make and Mage rely on the [Snyk](http://snyk.io/) CLI

## Eventing Options

The Lambda functions of the catalog service are triggered by [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/).

## Data Stores

The catalog service supports the following data stores:

* [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/): With [Makefile.dynamodb](./deploy/cloudformation), you can run run `make -f Makefile.dynamodb deploy` to create the DynamoDB table.

### Seeding Amazon DynamoDB

To start your journey off with random data in the Catalog table, you can use [`seed-dynamodb`](./cmd/seed-dynamodb). Running that program will add the default generated data (in [data.json](./cmd/seed-dynamodb/data.json)) into Amazon DynamoDB. To generate your own data, you can use [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) and import the [schema.json](./cmd/seed-dynamodb/schema.json) to start off.

## Using Amazon API Gateway

### Prerequisites for Amazon API Gateway

* [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) installed and configured

### Build and deploy for Amazon API Gateway

Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/retgits/acme-serverless-catalog
cd acme-serverless-catalog
```

Get the Go Module dependencies

```bash
go get ./...
```

Change directories to the [deploy/cloudformation](./deploy/cloudformation) folder

```bash
cd ./deploy/cloudformation
```

Use make to deploy

```bash
make build
make deploy
```

### Testing Amazon API Gateway

After the deployment you'll see the URL to which you can send the below mentioned API requests

## API

### `GET /products`

Returns a list of all catalog items

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://<id>.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod//products
```

```json
{
    "data": [
    {
      "id": "5c61f497e5fdadefe84ff9b9",
      "name": "Yoga Mat",
      "shortDescription": "Limited Edition Mat",
      "description": "Limited edition yoga mat",
      "imageUrl1": "/static/images/yogamat_square.jpg",
      "imageUrl2": "/static/images/yogamat_thumb2.jpg",
      "imageUrl3": "/static/images/yogamat_thumb3.jpg",
      "price": 62.5,
      "tags": [
          "mat"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "5c61f497e5fdadefe84ff9ba",
      "name": "Water Bottle",
      "shortDescription": "Best water bottle ever",
      "description": "For all those athletes out there, a perfect bottle to enrich you",
      "imageUrl1": "/static/images/bottle_square.jpg",
      "imageUrl2": "/static/images/bottle_thumb2.jpg",
      "imageUrl3": "/static/images/bottle_thumb3.jpg",
      "price": 34.99,
      "tags": [
          "bottle"
          ]
    }
    ]}
```

### `POST /product`

Create a new product item

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://<id>.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod//products \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '         {
            "name": "Tracker",
            "shortDescription": "Limited Edition Tracker",
            "description": "Limited edition Tracker with longer description",
            "imageurl1": "/static/images/tracker_square.jpg",
            "imageurl2": "/static/images/tracker_thumb2.jpg",
            "imageurl3": "/static/images/tracker_thumb3.jpg",
            "price": 149.99,
            "tags": [
                "tracker"
             ]

          }'
```

The call to this service needs a valid product object

```json
{
    "name": "Tracker",
    "shortDescription": "Limited Edition Tracker",
    "description": "Limited edition Tracker with longer description",
    "imageurl1": "/static/images/tracker_square.jpg",
    "imageurl2": "/static/images/tracker_thumb2.jpg",
    "imageurl3": "/static/images/tracker_thumb3.jpg",
    "price": 149.99,
    "tags": [
        "tracker"
    ]
}
```

When the product is created successfully, an HTTP/201 message is returned

```json
{
    "message": "Product created successfully!",
    "resourceId": {
        "id": "5c61f8f81d41c8e94ecaf25f",
        "name": "Tracker",
        "shortDescription": "Limited Edition Tracker",
        "description": "Limited edition Tracker with longer description",
        "imageUrl1": "/static/images/tracker_square.jpg",
        "imageUrl2": "/static/images/tracker_thumb2.jpg",
        "imageUrl3": "/static/images/tracker_thumb3.jpg",
        "price": 149.99,
        "tags": [
            "tracker"
        ]
    },
    "status": 201
}
```

### `GET /products/:id`

Returns details about a specific product id

```bash
curl --request GET \
  --url https://<id>.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/Prod//products/5c61f497e5fdadefe84ff9b9
```

```json
{
    "data": {
        "id": "5c61f497e5fdadefe84ff9b9",
        "name": "Yoga Mat",
        "shortDescription": "Limited Edition Mat",
        "description": "Limited edition yoga mat",
        "imageUrl1": "/static/images/yogamat_square.jpg",
        "imageUrl2": "/static/images/yogamat_square.jpg",
        "imageUrl3": "/static/images/bottle_square.jpg",
        "price": 62.5,
        "tags": [
            "mat"
        ]
    },
    "status": 200
}
```

## Using Make

The Makefiles in the [Cloudformation](./deploy/cloudformation) directory have a few a bunch of options available:

| Target  | Description                                                |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| build   | Build the executable for Lambda                            |
| clean   | Remove all generated files                                 |
| deploy  | Deploy the app to AWS                                      |
| destroy | Deletes the CloudFormation stack and all created resources |
| help    | Displays the help for each target (this message)           |
| vuln    | Scans the Go.mod file for known vulnerabilities using Snyk |

## Using Mage

If you want to "go all Go" (_pun intended_) and write plain-old go functions to build and deploy, you can use [Mage](https://magefile.org/). Mage is a make/rake-like build tool using Go so Mage automatically uses the functions you create as Makefile-like runnable targets.

### Prerequisites for Mage

To use Mage, you'll need to install it first:

```bash
go get -u -d github.com/magefile/mage
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/magefile/mage
go run bootstrap.go
```

### Targets

The Magefile in this repository has a bunch of targets available:

| Target | Description                                                                                              |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| build  | compiles the individual commands in the cmd folder, along with their dependencies.                       |
| clean  | removes object files from package source directories.                                                    |
| deploy | packages, deploys, and returns all outputs of your stack.                                                |
| deps   | resolves and downloads dependencies to the current development module and then builds and installs them. |
| test   | 'Go test' automates testing the packages named by the import paths.                                      |
| vuln   | uses Snyk to test for any known vulnerabilities in go.mod.                                               |
